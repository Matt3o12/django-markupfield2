# django-markdownfield2
Django Markdownfield 2 is a rewrite of [django-markdownfield](https://github.com/jamesturk/django-markupfield) by [James Turk](https://github.com/jamesturk).  
Due to Django 1.7's new migration system, it is now longer possible to add fields to a model safely and dynamically. So, we decided to rewrite the whole package that it will be usable with Django 1.7 and later. 

**The project is still in development. Use with causion!**
